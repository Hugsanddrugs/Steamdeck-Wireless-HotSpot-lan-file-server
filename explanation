ive never done anything like this. this is my first time trying anything like this. ive been working on this for weeks. the only issue left is clients having extremely slow uploads and downloads the bigger the download and longer it takes the slower the upload/ download. host upload and downloads are fast. seems to be a hardware issue i cant beat. anyone wanna take a shot go ahead. ive never put anything on github so please forgive my mistakes
